This plugin provides wildcard and regex filters for Pipeline Multibranch Plugin
pipelines.  The filter provides two behaviors beyond the default SCM filter

* It will match branches and pull requests destined for the matched
  branches.
* It will match branches and pull requests originating from the matched
  branches.

In both of the above scenarios, you can also add additional filters for matching
tags independently of branches.

# Setup

After installing this plugin four new options will appear in [Pipeline
Multibranch Plugin][multibranch-pipeline] jobs for configuring branch filters.
In additional behaviors, click on Add and you'll see the following additional
filters:

Choose only one filter.  The filter will match branches and tags to be built.
It will also match any pull request destination branch that matches a filtered
branch to also be built as a pull request by the [Pipeline Multibranch
Plugin][multibranch-pipeline] job.

# Configuring tag building

This plugin supports filtering both for branches, pull requests destined for
matched branches, **and tags**.  This plugin is meant to satisfy a typical
tag-based development workflow.  In order to build tags, tag discovery must be
configured in addition to specifying matching tags.

Here's a screenshot to filter tags with a regular expression (notice **Discover
tags** trait).

Here's a screenshot to filter tags with wildcards (notice **Discover tags**
trait).

# What is a PR?

Matching and building a PR, is what is called a Peer Review build in generic
terms of SCM.  Depending on the platform you're using it goes by different
names.  For example, GitHub (for Git) and Mercurial (another SCM) has Pull
Requests.  GitLab has Merge Requests.  In essence, these are all the same thing.
This plugin will match branches which are destined for the target branch
(usually main branch in Git) and build them as part of an automated peer
review.

# Pipeline scripting for branch build vs PR build vs tag build

In multibranch pipelines, it's not straight forward to tell the difference
between tags, pull requests, and regular branch builds.  Create a pipeline
shared library and add the following pipeline variables to it.

* `vars/isTagBuild.groovy`
* `vars/isPRBuild.groovy`

The source of `vars/isTagBuild.groovy`:

```groovy
import hudson.model.Job
import jenkins.scm.api.mixin.TagSCMHead
import org.jenkinsci.plugins.workflow.multibranch.BranchJobProperty

@NonCPS
Boolean isTagBuild(Job build_parent) {
    build_parent.getProperty(BranchJobProperty).branch.head in TagSCMHead
}

Boolean call() {
    isTagBuild(currentBuild.rawBuild.parent)
}
```

The source of `vars/isPRBuild.groovy`:

```groovy
import hudson.model.Job
import jenkins.scm.api.mixin.ChangeRequestSCMHead
import org.jenkinsci.plugins.workflow.multibranch.BranchJobProperty

@NonCPS
Boolean isPRBuild(Job build_parent) {
    build_parent.getProperty(BranchJobProperty).branch.head in ChangeRequestSCMHead
}

Boolean call() {
    isPRBuild(currentBuild.rawBuild.parent)
}
```

Now scripted and declarative pipelines can be written which can detect what
kind of build is occuring: branch build, tag build, PR build.  Here's some
example usage in scripted pipeline.

```groovy
if(isPRBuild()) {
    // do something because it is a PR build
}
if(isTagBuild()) {
    // do something because it is a tag build
}
if(!isPRBuild() && !isTagBuild()) {
    // do something only on branch builds and not on PR or tag build
}
```

# Shell scripting for main build or PR build

`CHANGE_ID` environment variable is populated for pull requests.  It is not set
when the triggered build is not a peer review.

### Shell scripting logic for branches vs pull requests

One can modify their build scripts to behave differently if a peer review is
being built vs a matched branch.  Here's an example in bash:

```bash
if [ -n "${CHANGE_ID}" ] ; then
  # do something because it's a pull request
else
  # not a pull request
fi
```

Additionally, it may be desired that a `Jenkinsfile` not run certain stages
when evaluating branches vs peer reviews (such as deploys).  This can be
accomplished two ways.

### Scripted pipeline syntax logic for branches vs pull requests

```groovy
if(env.CHANGE_ID) {
  // do something because it's a pull request
} else {
  // not a pull request
}
```

### Declarative pipeline syntax logic for branches vs pull requests

[Declarative pipelines provide a "when" condition][declarative-when].
Therefore, similar logic can be applied.  For example, deploy only when not a
peer review and it is the main branch.

```groovy
pipeline {
    stages {
        stage('Example Deploy') {
            when {
                allOf {
                    environment name: 'CHANGE_ID', value: ''
                    branch 'main'
                }
            }
            steps {
                // not a pull request so do something
            }
        }
    }
}
```
